# Reliability

- Psychological scales are not perfect

???

As we know, psychological scales are not perfect. A scale measuring people's happiness usually have random errors, and sometimes systematic errors. 

--

- Certain level of reliability needed

    * Statistical analyses are not trustworthy when the numbers are not consistent

# APA Journal Article Reporting Standards (JARS)

- In the [Psychometrics section](https://apastyle.apa.org/jars/quant-table-1.pdf) (Appelbaum, et al., 2018), researchers were asked to

&gt; Estimate and report values of reliability coefficients for the scores analyzed (i.e., the research's sample) (p. 7)

???

Similar recommendations can be found in numerous journal and methodological guidelines

# Reliability 

???

Before talking about multilevel reliability, I wanted to give just a quick introduction on the foundational work on reliability that this research relies on. 

---

# Classical Test Theory

.pull-left[

Lord &amp; Novick (1968)

Observed score = True score + Error

`$$Y = T + E$$`

`\(T\)` and `\(E\)` independent, so

`$$\sigma^2_Y = \sigma^2_T + \sigma^2_E$$`

]

.pull-right[

&lt;img src="Fordham_2021_Lai_mcfa_reliability_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-1-1.png" width="15%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

]

???

The presentation today will be drawing on the classical test theory framework, as described by the classic work by Lord &amp; Novick, which is the framework we use to define things like alpha and omega reliability. 

The idea in classical test theory is that, as shown on the graph here, the measured score of a person `\(Y\)`, say happiness, is determined by the person's true score or true happiness level, `\(T\)`, and some random error `\(E\)`. 

Notice that `\(T\)` and `\(E\)` are represented in circles as they are latent variables, meaning that they are not observables, and instead can only be inferred from the data. 

--

Reliability `\(\rho = \dfrac{\sigma^2_T}{\sigma^2_Y} = \dfrac{\sigma^2_T}{\sigma^2_T + \sigma^2_E} = [Corr(Y, T)]^2\)`

---

# Composite Reliability

### (Essential) Tau Equivalence

.pull-left[

&lt;img src="Fordham_2021_Lai_mcfa_reliability_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png" width="100%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

]

???

That is the case when we only have one item to measure happiness. When we have multiple items, say four items here, usually what we do is to assume that each item is an indicator of the true happiness construct. This is the idea of a factor model as represented in this figure. 

The tau equivalence assumption here means that the items all have loadings of 1, meaning that the true score variance in each item is the same.

# `\(\alpha\)` Reliability

Variance of unweighted composite: 
`$$\var(Z) = p^2 \psi + \sum_k \theta_k$$`
--

Reliability `\(\alpha = \dfrac{p^2 \psi}{\var(p^2 \psi + \sum_k \theta_k)}\)`

???

There were different ways to justify the derivation of `\(\alpha\)`

--

Alternative form: `\(\alpha = \dfrac{p}{p - 1} \left(1 - \dfrac{\tr(\bv \Sigma)}{\bv 1' \bv \Sigma \bv 1}\right)\)`

???

The idea is that we can simply use the covariance matrix of the items to compute reliability, without the need to do a factor analysis.

# `\(\omega\)` Reliability

- True Score Variance `\(\var(T) = (\sum_k \lambda_k)^2 \psi\)`

- Error Variance `\(\var(E) = \sum_k \theta_k\)`

Reliability `\(\omega = \dfrac{\var(T)}{\var(T) + \var(E)}\)`

### Note: Reliability is a property of observed test scores `\((Z)\)`, not the latent scores `\((\eta)\)`

# Multilevel Reliability

Lai (2021)

---

# Example

2007 Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS; Williams et al., 2009)
* 7,896 students (4th grade) from 515 schools

Positive attitudes toward math (PATM)  

| Item     | Wording                          |
| -------- | ---------------------------------|
| AS4MAMOR | Would like to do more math       |
| AS4MAENJ | I enjoy learning mathematics     |
| AS4MALIK | I like math                      |
| AS4MABOR | Math is boring (reverse-coded)   |

???

With this kind of multilevel data, in analysis we need to account for the clustering structure, as it violates the independent observation assumptions; otherwise the statistical inferences will be incorrect. 

---

# Multilevel Reliability Not Consistently Reported 

Kim et al. (2016): Only 54% reported reliability, among 39 articles using multilevel confirmatory factor analysis (MCFA)

- Usually only one reliability reported for one scale

???

However, discussion on multilevel reliability is not new

---

# Reliability Options in the Literature

Ignore clustering

- Omit uncertainty (*SE* too small/CI too narrow)
    * Can use multilevel factor analysis (Raykov, et al., 2005; Raykov, et al., 2006)

- No level-specific information

---

### Level-Specific Reliability (Geldhof, et al., 2014)

### "Unconstrained" Multilevel Factor Model

`\(j\)` indexes cluster

`$$\bv Y_{ij} = \bv \nu + \underbrace{\bv \lambda^b \eta^b_j + \bv \epsilon^b_{j}}_\text{between model} + \underbrace{\bv \lambda^w_j \eta^w_{ij} + \bv \epsilon^w_{ij}}_\text{within model}$$`

- Between- and within- "reliability" coefficients

]

???

No cross-level invariance

`\(\epsilon\)` is the uniqueness, separated into the within and the between level

---

For the TIMSS data

- Est `\(\tilde \omega^w\)` = .857, 95% CI [.849, .863]

- Est `\(\tilde \omega^b\)` = &lt;span style="color:red"&gt;.977, 95% CI [.964, .987]&lt;/span&gt;

--

Not uncommon in the literature . . . 

--

- Positive and negative affects: `\(\tilde \omega^b\)` = .94 to .97 (Rush, et al., 2014)

- Instructional Skills Questionnaire: `\(\tilde \alpha^b\)` between .90 to .99 (Knol, et al., 2016)

  \alpha^{b} &amp; = \frac{p}{p - 1}\left(\frac{\sum_{k \neq k'} \sigma^{b}_{k k'}}{\bv 1'\bv \Sigma^b \bv 1 + \bv 1' \bv \Sigma^w \bv 1 / \tilde n}\right) \\
  \alpha^{w} &amp; = \frac{p}{p - 1}\left(\frac{\sum_{k \neq k'} \sigma^{w}_{k k'}}{\bv 1' \bv \Sigma^w \bv 1}\right)

# Which One(s) to Report?

- If a variable is partitioned in a multilevel model (most likely an individual construct), all three `\((\omega^{2l}, \omega^{b}, \omega^{w})\)` should be reported

    * Cluster means and cluster-mean centered predictors
    
    * Outcome variable

# Summary

Computing and reporting reliability information is important for multilevel data

- Both cross-sectional and longitudinal

--

Reliability information is needed for raw, cluster means, and cluster-mean centered scores

--

Previous approach to between-level reliability is an overestimate when cluster size is small

--

Nature of target construct should be considered, and it has implications on reliability computation
- E.g., "shared" constructs

# Influence of ICC and Cluster Size

Assume cross-level invariance holds and `\(\omega^{2l} = .8\)`

 `\(\mathrm{ICC}(\eta) = \frac{\psi^b}{\psi^b + \psi^w}\)`

# Relation to Generalizability Theory

Most meaningful with systematic time effects

Cranford, et al. (2006): generalizability coefficients for diary studies

???

Not the case for the MIDUS data, as everyone starts on a different day

--

&amp;zwj;Differences:

- Fixed vs. Random item facet (in estimation)

--

- Relax the essential parallel test assumption
    * Item-specific loadings and uniqueness

--

- Test invariance assumptions

--

- Flexible SEM modeling
