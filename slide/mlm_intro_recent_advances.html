# Applications of MLM

Psychotherapy
- Heterogeneity of treatment effectiveness across therapists

Educational research
- Teacher expectations on students' performance

Organizational research
- Job strain and ambulatory blood pressure

---

# Applications of MLM (cont'd)

Cross-national/neighborhood research
- Sociopolitical influence on psychological processes (e.g., age and generalized trust)
- Post-materialism, locus of control, and concern for global warming

Longitudinal analysis/repeated measures
- Aging, self-esteem, and stress appraisal

---

# Example Data



Sample simulated data on students' popularity .font60[(Hox, Moerbeek, and Van
de
Schoot, 2018)]
- 2000 pupils (level 1) in 100 classrooms
(level 2)

Main outcome:
- `popular`: popularity teacher evaluation (0 to 10)

# Dependent (Correlated) Observations

With clustered data, an assumption of OLS regression is violated

One score informs another score in the same cluster

Overlap: reduces effective information (\\(N_\text{eff}\\)) in data

???

Two students in the same class give less than two pieces of information

# Consequences

Assuming independent obs, OLS understates the uncertainty in the estimates
- _SE_ too small; CI too narrow

&lt;!-- Variance of intercepts = 0.892 (_SD_ = 0.944) --&gt;

Variance of slopes = 0.026 (_SD_ = 0.161)
- For a majority of schools (within +/- 1 _SD_), slope expected in the range
[0.332, 0.654]. 

???
for linear relations, only need to know the intercept and the slope;
