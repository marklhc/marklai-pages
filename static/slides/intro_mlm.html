Hierarchical linear model (HLM; Raudenbush and Bryk, 2002)

Mixed/Mixed-effects model (Littell, Milliken, Stroup, and Wolfinger, 1996)

Leeuw and Kreft, 1986)

Variance component model (Aitkin and Longford, 1986)

# Roadmap

What are multilevel data?

Why use MLM?  
- Avoid underestimated _SE_
- Research questions at different levels
- Cluster-specific (or person-specific) regression lines

---

# Multilevel Data

Nested Data
- Students in classrooms/schools
- Siblings in families
- Clients in therapy groups/therapists/clinics
- Employees in organizations in countries

Educational research
- teacher expectations on students' performance

Organizational research
- Job strain and ambulatory blood pressure

---

# Applications of MLM (cont'd)

Cross-national/neighborhood research
- Sociopolitical influence on psychological processes (e.g., age and generalized trust)
- Post-materialism, locus of control, and concern for global warming

Longitudinal analysis/repeated measures
- Aging, self-esteem, and stress appraisal

---

# Example Data



Sample simulated data on students' popularity from Hox, Moerbeek, 
&amp; van de Schoot (2018)
- 2000 pupils (level 1) in 100 classrooms
(level 2)

# Quantify Clustering

Intraclass correlation:
`$$\mathrm{ICC} = \frac{\sigma^2_\text{cluster}}
                      {\sigma^2_\text{cluster} + \sigma^2_\text{individual}}$$`

ICC = prop. var at cluster level  
    = average correlation between two individuals in the same cluster
    
Variance components: `\(\sigma^2_\text{cluster}\)`, `\(\sigma^2_\text{individual}\)`

# Dependent (Correlated) Observations

# Consequences

Assuming independent obs, OLS understates the uncertainty in the estimates
- _SE_ too small; CI too narrow
