<h2>Assignment Description</h2>
<p>As the second part of the peer-review process, each individual student will comment on postings of <strong>two</strong> other groups. You can find your assigned posts on the Discussion Board on Blackboard. You comments will consist of (a) completeness of the posting and (b) at least one suggestion to help the group improve their project. Make sure your critique is constructive; the instructor reserves the right to delete comments that do not conform to professional standards. Your comments will be due 9 am PST on Monday 11/9. The comments will be worth 2 points (1 point for each).</p>

<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>Whether the post contains all necessary components based on the “Posting for Peer Review Rubric.” Here you don’t need to evaluate the quality of the post; just the completeness of the components. The components include
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman">
<li>name of each group member</li>
<li>a link for the data repository</li>
<li>Rmd source code and knitted document in the repository</li>
<li>research question(s)</li>
<li>model equations</li>
<li>a coefficient table</li>
<li>a plot</li>
<li>a summary paragraph for the analysis</li>
</ol></li>
<li>A summary (1-2 sentences are fine) of what you like about the post, or what you think the group did well.</li>
<li>A minimum of one suggestion that you think would improve the analysis. For example, you can suggest inclusion of additional variables in the model, ways to make the graph easier to read, better ways to present the findings, etc. You are welcome to provide more suggestions.</li>
</ol></li>
