<h2>Learning Objective</h2>

<h2>Assignment Description</h2>
<p>A prospectus about your project should be submitted by <strong>Monday, October 5, 2020</strong>. The prospectus should contain a concise description of what you (or your group) plan to do for your project, including a brief description of your research question(s), study design, structure of the data, and a preliminary plan for statistical analysis. The prospectus should be limited to 1 single-spaced page (excluding references and any supplemental materials).</p>
<p>In addition, the project requires you to create a repository for your project so that you can share your analytic scripts. You can also upload data files (if it’s sharable and without identifiable information) any supplemental materials, but those are optional. Your prospectus should include a link to the repository you created for your project.</p>
<p>Note: If you’re working as a group, only one member needs to submit the prospectus.</p>

<li><p>Indicate whether you/your group will do a paper or a presentation. Only one paper/presentation is required for each group.</p></li>

<li>Additional information that would facilitate discussions (e.g., network graphs of the data structure, flow chart of experimental designs, etc)</li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>Create a repository for your project. One easy way is to do it with the Open Science Framework (OSF; see <a href="https://help.osf.io/hc/en-us/articles/360019737594-Create-a-Project" class="uri">https://help.osf.io/hc/en-us/articles/360019737594-Create-a-Project</a>), and you can log in with your USC credential (go to <a href="https://accounts.osf.io/login" class="uri">https://accounts.osf.io/login</a>, then select “Sign in through institution”). Alternatively, if you’re familiar with GitHub (or other similar platforms), you can use that as well.</p></li>
<li><p>At the end of your prospectus (before references and any supplemental materials), include the following statement:
&gt; The data analytic scripts and supplemental materials for this project will be available at [insert the link to your repository]</p>
