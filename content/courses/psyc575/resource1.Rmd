Here's a [blog post from Andrew Gelman](https://projects.economist.com/us-2020-forecast/president) for a forecast model that uses multilevel modeling for the 2020 presidential election in the US. The forecast can be found on [The Economist](https://projects.economist.com/us-2020-forecast/president). See also a [follow-up discussion on Nate Silver's criticism on the model](https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2020/07/31/thinking-about-election-forecast-uncertainty/). Be careful that some sources of uncertainty seem missing in the model. 

Here's the [website by Tom Snijders that accompanies your textbook](https://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~snijders/mlbook.htm). It includes sample data sets, R codes, and some further readings. 

Finally, I just found this list of [All the names for hierarchical and multilevel modeling](https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2019/09/18/all-the-names-for-hierarchical-and-multilevel-modeling/) by Bob Carpenter.
