<p>Here’s a <a href="https://projects.economist.com/us-2020-forecast/president">blog post from Andrew Gelman</a> for a forecast model that uses multilevel modeling for the 2020 presidential election in the US. The forecast can be found on <a href="https://projects.economist.com/us-2020-forecast/president">The Economist</a>. See also a <a href="https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2020/07/31/thinking-about-election-forecast-uncertainty/">follow-up discussion on Nate Silver’s criticism on the model</a>. Be careful that some sources of uncertainty seem missing in the model.</p>
<p>Here’s the <a href="https://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~snijders/mlbook.htm">website by Tom Snijders that accompanies your textbook</a>. It includes sample data sets, R codes, and some further readings.</p>
<p>Finally, I just found this list of <a href="https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2019/09/18/all-the-names-for-hierarchical-and-multilevel-modeling/">All the names for hierarchical and multilevel modeling</a> by Bob Carpenter.</p>
