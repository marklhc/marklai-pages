<h2>Learning Objective</h2>
<ul>
<li>Independently analyze real data using statistical software for multilevel modeling</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="assignment-description" class="section level2">
<h2>Assignment Description</h2>
<p>In this assignment, you will use the “happy_combined.sav” data set to fit two
different multilevel models using R. The given data set is a subset of the World Value Survey–1990-93 data (World Values Study Group, 1994). There are five variables in the data set:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><code>CountryID</code>: Country ID</li>
<li><code>country</code>: Country’s name</li>
<li><code>gm_GNP</code>: Grand-mean centered Gross National Product (rescaled by 1/10,000)</li>
<li><code>income</code>: Income level (0-<em>least income</em> to 9-<em>most income</em>)</li>
<li><code>happy</code>: Feel happy (1-<em>not happy</em> to 4-<em>very happy</em>)</li>
</ol>
<p>Follow the instructions and complete the assignment by <strong>September 4</strong>. This assignment is worth 6 points.</p>

<div id="steps" class="section level2">
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Download the <a href="/hw_templates/hw3_template.Rmd"><code>hw3_template.Rmd</code> file</a>. Rename it as <code>hw3_yourlastnameyourfirstname.Rmd</code> (e.g., <code>hw3_LaiMark.Rmd</code>), and write down your name inside the Rmd.</li>
<li>Provide a short description of the sample (e.g., units and sample sizes at
each level, number of participants per country, etc), as well as the descriptive statistics for the three variables <code>gm_GNP</code>, <code>income</code>, and <code>happy</code>. Indicate at which level each of the three variables are defined.</li>
<li>Fit a random intercept model (i.e., <code>Happy</code> as the outcome variable and no
predictor in the model)
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman">
<li>Calculate the intraclass correlation</li>
<li>Adapt the <a href="../rcode3/#showing-the-variations-across-a-subset-of-schools">code in the “Showing the variations” section</a> to plot the distribution of <code>Happy</code> across a random sample of 5-10 countries. (Hint: you should use the <code>country</code> variable for plotting as that has the names of the countries)</li>
<li>Based on the model, which country has the highest level of happiness? Which has the lowest?
<!-- 4. Adapt the [code in the "Simulating Data" section](../rcode3/#simulating-data-based-on-the-random-intercept-model) to simulate a `happy` variable similar to the provided data, but with $\tau^2_0 = 0$. Obtain a similar plot as the one in 3 (ii) for the simulated data, and write a quick paragraph to discuss similarities or differences in the plots.  --></li>
</ol></li>
<li>Calculate the design effect for the original data. Is a multilevel model needed with <code>happy</code> as the outcome?</li>
<li>Add <code>gm_GNP</code> as a predictor to the model
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman">
<li>Write out the model equation(s)</li>
<li>Obtain a 95% confidence interval and interpret the fixed effect coefficient of <code>gm_GNP</code>.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Knit your Rmd file to HTML/PDF/Word, and submit the knitted file to Blackboard.</li>
</ol>
