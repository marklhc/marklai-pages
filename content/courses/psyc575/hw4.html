<h2>Learning Objective</h2>
<ul>
<li>Independently analyze real data using statistical software for multilevel modeling</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="assignment-description" class="section level2">
<h2>Assignment Description</h2>
<p>In this assignment, you will continue to use the “happy_combined.sav” data set and analyze models using <code>income</code> as a predictor.</p>
<p>Follow the instructions and complete the assignment by <strong>September 11</strong>. This assignment is worth 6 points.</p>
</div>
<div id="steps" class="section level2">
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>(Optional) Use the same <a href="/hw_templates/hw3_template.Rmd"><code>hw3_template.Rmd</code> file</a>. Rename it as <code>hw4_yourlastnameyourfirstname.Rmd</code> (e.g., <code>hw4_LaiMark.Rmd</code>), and write down your name inside the Rmd.</li>
<li>Compute the intraclass correlation (ICC) of the <code>income</code> variable across countries. Does the ICC suggest that there are substantial country-level variability for the <code>income</code> variable?</li>
<li>Include <code>income</code> into the model to predict <code>happy</code>, and decompose its effect into the between-within effects. Also, allow the within-country slopes for <code>income</code> to vary across countries.
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman">
<li>Write out the model equation(s)</li>
<li>Write a paragraph to interpret the model results. In your write-up, it should include (a) the fixed-effects, (b) the random slope variance. You can reference the slides for how to interpret these coefficients.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>From the previous model, include <code>gm_GNP</code> and its cross-level interaction with individual-level <code>income</code>. Random slopes of Income should be included too.
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman">
<li>Write out the model equation(s)</li>
<li>Report the <a href="../rcode4/#simple-slopes">simple slope</a> for individual-level income when (a) <code>gm_GNP</code> = -1
(i.e., 1 SD below the mean, which was a similar level as China in the 90s)<br />
and (b) <code>gm_GNP</code> = 2 (i.e., 2 SD above the mean, which was a similar level as Switzerland in the 90s)</li>
<li>Provide a graph showing the relations between individual-level income and <code>happy</code> for countries with different levels of <code>gm_GNP</code>. You can use the <code>interactions::interact_plot()</code> function</li>
<li>Compute an <span class="math inline">\(R^2\)</span> effect size for this model.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Show a table summarizing the coefficients for the two models in (3) and (4).</li>
<li>Knit your Rmd file to HTML/PDF/Word, and submit the knitted file to Blackboard.</li>
</ol>
