<h2>Learning Objective</h2>
<ul>
<li>Identify the types of multilevel data structure in different research scenarios</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="assignment-description" class="section level2">
<h2>Assignment Description</h2>
<p>In this first assignment, you will first introduce yourself on the Slack channel. You will then find a published research article in your area of research in which the authors have used a multilevel analysis, and indicate the information on a Google Sheet. Complete the two parts (self-introduction and article search) of the assignment by <strong>August 21</strong>. This assignment is worth 6 points.</p>

<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Introduce yourself on Slack
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>Go to the Slack #introduce-ourselves channel for this course. You will need to sign on. If youâ€™re new to Slack, check out <a href="https://keepteaching.usc.edu/students/student-toolkit/classroom/slack/">this USC guide</a></li>
<li>In the <strong>Message</strong> box, write
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman">
<li>a brief description of your background (e.g., your major, research interest)</li>
<li>the reason of taking this course</li>
<li>your experience of using R or other statistical programs/packages</li>
<li>something else about yourself that you want to share with the class</li>
</ol></li>
<li>(Optional) Review and comment on peer messages using threads</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Find a journal article that reported results of a multilevel analysis in your field.</li>
<li>Go to the Google spreadsheet at <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18jdCyfu5eqFQ30YblABft-o5F5ozY5SdO2E7Z3ZYJCs" class="uri">https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18jdCyfu5eqFQ30YblABft-o5F5ozY5SdO2E7Z3ZYJCs</a>. In a new row, record the following information from the article:
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>The full reference of the article (with the DOI)</li>
<li>The research question (summarized in one sentence)</li>
<li>The unit of each level (e.g., students, classrooms, schools; hospitals, states; repeated measures, persons)</li>
<li>The sample size for each level</li>
<li>Whether the authors present equation(s) for their model</li>
<li>The software used for the multilevel analyses</li>
<li>Did the authors include any tables to present the results? If yes, record the types of tables were those (e.g., correlations, descriptives, fixed effect coefficients)?</li>
<li>Did the authors include any graphs to present the results? If yes, what types of graphs were those (e.g., path diagrams, scatterplots)?</li>
</ol></li>
