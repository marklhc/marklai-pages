<h2>Learning Objective</h2>
<ul>
<li>Apply multilevel modeling in a research project</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="assignment-description" class="section level2">
<h2>Assignment Description</h2>
<p>As part of the peer-review process, your group will submit a revised prospectus and a knitted document of part of your data analysis for peer review. The purpose of the assignment is to make sure you are on track for completing your final paper/presentation, as the equations, plot, interpretation, etc, will likely be part of your final work. Also, you will have a chance to receive feedback from your peers, as well as to learn from your peers’ week in the evaluation phase. Posting will be worth 3 points.</p>
<p>Note: If you’re working as a group, only one member needs to post to the Discussion Board.</p>

<div id="steps" class="section level2">
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Revise your prospectus to clarify any inconsistency and provide updated information on your data description and data analysis plan. The revised prospectus should include
<ul>
<li>Sufficient background to understand your research</li>
<li>Research questions clearly defined</li>
<li>A description of the nesting structure of your data</li>
<li>Your plan of data analysis</li>
</ul></li>
<li>For this assignment, you will run one multilevel model related to your research questions using R Markdown. You can combine your revised prospectus with your analysis into one R Markdown file, but this is optional. <strong>The R Markdown should be named “preliminary_mlm.Rmd”</strong>, and should include
<ul>
<li>Model equations for one multilevel analysis</li>
<li>Reproducible code of the analysis</li>
<li>A coefficient table for the model</li>
<li>A plot illustrating the association between a major predictor in the model and the outcome variable. Include random slopes if appropriate.<br />
</li>
<li>A short paragraph summarizing the findings from your model addressing your research questions.
[Note: the equations, code, table, and plot would likely be in your final paper/presentation anyway.]</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Knit your Rmd file to HTML/PDF/Word, and upload both the source Rmd file and the knitted file to the repository for your project. Make sure you don’t include any confidential information of your data.</li>
<li>Make sure your have a link for your repository in your revised prospectus that the reviewer can access.</li>
<li>Post your revised prospectus to the dedicated forum on the Discussion board on Blackboard. For each group, only one post is needed.</li>
</ol>
