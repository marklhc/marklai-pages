# Biography

I am an Assistant Professor in the [Quantitative and Mixed Method Research 
Methodology (QMRM) 
Program](http://cech.uc.edu/programs/educational_studies/phd-in-edst/concentrations/qmrm.html)
in the School of Education at the University of Cincinnati. I received my Ph.D. 
in Educational Psychology at Texas A&M University.

I come from [Macau](https://en.wikipedia.org/?title=Macau) and speaks Cantonese 
as my native language. Mathematics has always been a favorite subject to me, but
my growing interest in understanding the human mind lead me to pursue a bachelor
degree in Psychology at the University of Macau, where I discovered that a
career of developing and applying quantitative methods in the social sciences
would be a very good fit to me.

I am interested in all kinds of statistical methods, but currently my research 
areas include multilevel modeling, structural equation modeling, effect size 
statistics, and measurement invariance. I also have collaborations on projects 
studying the prevalence, antecedents and consequences of gambling disorder, and 
in other areas such as special education, evolutionary psychology, health 
sciences, etc.
