## Note

I am taking a Ph.D. student interested in quantitative methods (including but
not limited to: multilevel modeling, structural equation modeling, effect size
estimation, psychometrics) in the 2019-2020 academic year. Feel free to contact
me regarding fit. Please apply at https://dornsife.usc.edu/psyc/admissions/

# Biography

I am an Assistant Professor of Quantitative Methods in the [Department of
Psychology](https://dornsife.usc.edu/psyc/) at the University of Southern
California. I received my Ph.D. in Educational Psychology at Texas A&M
University, and worked as an Assistant Professor at the University of Cincinnati
prior to joining USC.

I am from [Macau](https://en.wikipedia.org/?title=Macau) and speaks Cantonese as
my native language. Mathematics has always been a favorite subject to me, but my
growing interest in understanding the human mind lead me to pursue a bachelor
degree in Psychology at the University of Macau, where I discovered that a
career of developing and applying quantitative methods in the social sciences
would be a very good fit to me.

I am interested in all kinds of statistical methods, but currently my research
areas include multilevel modeling, structural equation modeling, effect size
statistics, and measurement invariance. I also have collaborations on projects
studying the prevalence, antecedents and consequences of gambling disorder, and
in other areas such as evolutionary psychology, social psychology, developmental
sciences, health sciences, etc.
