I'm especially interested in applicants who

- Are motivated and can persist through challenging research problems
- Has a strong interest in statistical and data analytic methods and their
applications in broader behavioral and social science research problems
- Are willing to learn technical stuffs, including statistical theories, 
computational and programming skills (e.g., R and Julia), and engage in 
technical writing and programming

[The standard package in our program provides five years of support](https://dornsife.usc.edu/psyc/financial-aid/). Student from minority and 
underrepresented groups are especially encouraged to apply. Potential 
applicants are also encouraged to check out the [Awards and Fellowships 
Database](https://awardsdatabase.usc.edu/app/index.asp) at USC, which includes
internal and external opportunities for students of different demographics. 

## Tips on Preparing Your Statement

The following only represents what I personally would pay attention to 
when reviewing applications. You're encouraged to check out other resources, 
such as [this excellent post](https://nivlab.princeton.edu/pnipsy-graduate-phd-program-application-tips), 
for more general advice. 

First, be sure to highlight why you are interested in quantitative/statistical
methods. Tell me a little bit more how you get interested in them, and it 
would be great if you can share some concrete examples showing your passion. 
Things like class projects, thesis, courses you've taken, books you've 
reading, or anything that motivates you to get into quant. 

Second, tell me any relevant experience you've had. For example, what 
statistical software/programming language do you use? What statistical methods
are you interested in or have you learned? What relevant courses you've taken
that you found interesting? You're going to learn different methods in the 
graduate program, but having some previous experience would help the transition.

Third, talk a little bit about your goals and how getting in grad school can 
help you with your goals. It is understandable that you may not have a clear 
picture now, and it is not uncommon for people to change their plans during
grad school (I did too), but at least putting a plan into writing shows that you
have given some thoughts on your future.
