abstract = {Individually randomized treatments are often administered within a group setting. As a consequence, outcomes for treated individuals may be correlated due to provider effects, common experiences within the group, and/or informal processes of socialization. In contrast, it is often reasonable to regard outcomes for control participants as independent, given that these individuals are not placed into groups. Although this kind of design is common in intervention research, the statistical models applied to evaluate the treatment effects are usually inconsistent with the resulting data structure, potentially leading to biased inferences. This article presents an alternative model that explicitly accounts for the fact that only treated participants are grouped. In addition to providing a useful test of the overall treatment effect, this approach also permits one to formally determine the extent to which treatment effects vary over treatment groups and whether there is evidence that individuals within treatment groups become similar to one another. This strategy is demonstrated with data from the Reconnecting Youth program for high school students at risk of school failure and behavioral disorders.},

abstract = {Appropriately centering Level 1 predictors is vital to the interpretation of intercept and slope parameters in multilevel models (MLMs). The issue of centering has been discussed in the literature, but it is still widely misunderstood. The purpose of this article is to provide a detailed overview of grand mean centering and group mean centering in the context of 2-level MLMs. The authors begin with a basic overview of centering and explore the differences between grand and group mean centering in the context of some prototypical research questions. Empirical analyses of artificial data sets are used to illustrate key points throughout. The article provides a number of practical recommendations designed to facilitate centering decisions in MLM applications.},

@article{MacKinnon2004,
abstract = {Various approaches using the maximum likelihood (ML) option of the LISREL program and products of indicators have been proposed to analyze structural equation models with non-linear latent effects on the basis of Kenny and Judd's formulation. Recently, some methods based off the Bayesian approach and the exact ML approaches have been developed. This article reviews, elaborates and compares several approaches for analyzing nonlinear models with interaction and/or quadratic effects. A total of four approaches arc examined, including the product indicator ML approaches proposed by Jaccard and Wan (1995) and Joreskog and Yang (1996), a Bayesian approach and an exact ML approach. The empirical performances of these approaches are assessed using simulation studies in terms of their capabilities in producing reliable parameter and standard error estimates. It is found that whilst the Bayesian and the exact ML approaches produce satisfactory results in all the settings under consideration, and are in general very reliable; the product indicator ML approaches only produce reasonable results in Simple models with large sample sizes.},

@article{Cheung2009,
abstract = {Mediation models are often used as a means to explain the psychological mechanisms between an independent and a dependent variable in the behavioral and social sciences. A major limitation of the unstandardized indirect effect calculated from raw scores is that it cannot be interpreted as an effect-size measure. In contrast, the standardized indirect effect calculated from standardized scores can be a good candidate as a measure of effect size because it is scale invariant. In the present article, 11 methods for constructing the confidence intervals (CIs) of the standardized indirect effects were evaluated via a computer simulation. These included six Wald CIs, three bootstrap CIs, one likelihood-based CI, and the PRODCLIN CI. The results consistently showed that the percentile bootstrap, the bias-corrected bootstrap, and the likelihood-based approaches had the best coverage probability. Mplus, LISREL, and Mx syntax were included to facilitate the use of these preferred methods in applied settings. Future issues on the use of the standardized indirect effects are discussed.},

@article{Miocevic2017,
abstract = {This project examined the performance of classical and Bayesian estimators of four effect size measures for the indirect effect in a single-mediator model and a two-mediator model. Compared to the proportion and ratio mediation effect sizes, standardized mediation effect-size measures were rela-tively unbiased and efficient in the single-mediator model and the two-mediator model. Percentile and bias-corrected boot-strap interval estimates of ab/s Y , and ab(s X)/s Y in the single-mediator model outperformed interval estimates of the proportion and ratio effect sizes in terms of power, Type I error rate, coverage, imbalance, and interval width. For the two-mediator model, standardized effect-size measures were superior to the proportion and ratio effect-size measures. Furthermore, it was found that Bayesian point and interval summaries of posterior distributions of standardized effect-size measures reduced excessive relative bias for certain pa-rameter combinations. The standardized effect-size measures are the best effect-size measures for quantifying mediated effects.},
