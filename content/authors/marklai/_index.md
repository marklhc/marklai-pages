I am an Assistant Professor of Psychology (Quantitative Methods) in the
[Department of Psychology](https://dornsife.usc.edu/psyc/) at the University of
Southern California. I am from [Macau](https://en.wikipedia.org/?title=Macau) and speaks Cantonese as
my native language. Mathematics has always been a favorite subject to me, but my
growing interest in understanding the human mind lead me to pursue a bachelor
degree in Psychology at the University of Macau, where I discovered that a
career of developing and applying quantitative methods in the social sciences
would be a very good fit to me.

I am interested in all kinds of statistical methods, but currently my research
areas include multilevel modeling, structural equation modeling, effect size
statistics, and measurement invariance. I also have collaborations on projects
studying the prevalence, antecedents and consequences of gambling disorder, and
in other areas such as evolutionary psychology, social psychology, developmental
sciences, health sciences, etc.

I plan to take a Ph.D. student interested in quantitative and statistical
methods (including but not limited to: multilevel modeling, structural equation
modeling, effect size estimation, psychometrics, and statistical learning) in 
the 2021-2022 academic year. 

To learn more about the doctoral program at USC and speak to a program advisor, check out the [Preview Day](https://dornsife.usc.edu/psyc/preview-day/) event.
