abstract = "Establishing measurement invariance, or that an instrument measures
the same construct(s) in the same way across subgroups of respondents, is
crucial in efforts to validate social and behavioral instruments. Although
substantial previous research has focused on detecting the presence of
noninvariance, less attention has been devoted to its practical significance and
even less has been paid to its possible impact on diagnostic accuracy. In this
article, we draw additional attention to the importance of measurement
invariance and advance diagnostic research by introducing a novel approach for
quantifying the impact of noninvariance with binary items (e.g., the presence or
absence of symptoms). We illustrate this approach by testing measurement
invariance and evaluating diagnostic accuracy across age groups using DSM
alcohol use disorder items from a public national data set. By providing
researchers with an easy-to-implement R program for examining diagnostic
accuracy with binary items, this article sets the stage for future evaluations
of the practical significance of partial invariance. Future work can extend our
framework to include ordinal and categorical indicators, other measurement
models in item response theory, settings with three or more groups, and via
comparison to an external, “gold-standard” validator."
